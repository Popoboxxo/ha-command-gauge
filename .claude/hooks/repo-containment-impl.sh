#!/bin/bash
# version: 1.0.0
# Real repo-containment ("prison mode") logic. NOT a standalone hook —
# invoked by repo-containment.sh (thin self-health wrapper, issue #630), which
# pipes the PreToolUse JSON payload to this script's stdin after syntax-
# checking it. Do not register this file directly in settings.json (it has no
# `# hook:`/`# event:` header on purpose, so scripts/lib/hooks.py never
# registers it as its own hook entry).
# The `# version:` line above IS still read by check_stale_deployed_hooks()
# (scripts/lib/consistency/hook_drift.py, issue #630) so a project that
# doesn't re-sync after this file changes gets a drift warning — bump it
# whenever this file's logic changes, independent of the wrapper's version.
#
# What this hook does (spec docs/concepts/repo-containment-prison-mode.md §4.1):
#   * Write/Edit  -> resolve tool_input.file_path and allow it only when it is
#                    inside the repo root. <repo root>/<tmp-sink.path> is a
#                    special carve-out: allowed when the sink is enabled,
#                    blocked when it is disabled (spec §7: ".tmp mit aktivem
#                    Sink -> 0; .tmp ohne Sink -> 2"), even though it sits
#                    inside the root.
#   * Bash        -> best-effort tokenized detection of write-ish commands /
#                    redirections; block obvious writes outside the allowed
#                    roots, allow reads.
#   * All other tools (Read/Glob/Grep/...) exit 0 untouched.
#
# Config & precedence: the master switch and tmp-sink settings live in
# .meta-config/project.yaml. Precedence mirrors scripts/lib/repo_containment.py
# §2.3 exactly:
#     provider-override > project repo_containment.enabled > default true
# We deliberately do NOT import scripts/lib/repo_containment.py at runtime:
# that module is an agent-meta-internal, sync-time library and is NOT deployed
# into target projects together with the hooks (only hooks/ is), so importing
# it would fail in exactly the projects this guard protects. Instead we reuse
# the SAME config-reading mechanism as orchestrator-guard-impl.sh (python3 +
# yaml.safe_load on .meta-config/project.yaml, passing the path as argv so
# backslash-bearing Windows paths are never string-interpolated) and mirror
# the resolver's precedence and safe-side rules inline. The tmp-sink path is
# re-validated (relative, non-empty, no drive-letter prefix, no '..' segments,
# not the repo root itself) before it widens the allow-list.
#
# Provider identity: `AGENT_META_PROVIDER` is substituted per provider by
# sync.py's per-provider copy step (scripts/lib/hooks.py:470,
# `source_content.replace("Claude", provider)`), exactly like
# orchestrator-guard-impl.sh. That is the one reliable provider signal
# available to a hook at runtime (the PreToolUse payload carries no provider
# field and no documented provider env var exists), so we use it. When the
# file is run straight from source (never synced) the placeholder is left
# literal — it is then treated as "no provider", so precedence falls back to
# the project value > default. No `if provider == "Name"` branch exists here:
# the override lookup is a plain dict keyed by the provided name.
#
# Fail-mode (issue #630): the wrapper owns the missing-/broken-impl handling.
# This impl itself fails CLOSED on a missing helper lib, a missing python
# interpreter (issue #595 posture) and on an empty/malformed payload.
#
# Safe-side (F4): a missing, unreadable or unparseable config resolves to
# ENABLED, and a present-but-non-boolean `enabled` also resolves to ENABLED —
# the hook never silently opens on doubt. The sync-time validator
# (scripts/lib/config.py::_validate_repo_containment) hard-exits on a
# non-boolean value; the runtime safe-side rule below does not contradict
# that, it only prevents the hook from opening in the meantime.
#
# Coexistence: this hook is independent of orchestrator-guard.sh — same
# PreToolUse event, separate concern (containment vs. delegation/git gates).
# Both run; neither reads the other's state. Unlike orchestrator-guard, this
# hook imposes no role/sentinel logic.
#
# Best-effort boundary (issue #592, deliberate): the Bash path is a
# convention boundary, NOT a security boundary — see
# .claude/rules/branch-guard.md#guard-terminologie-convention-boundary-vs-
# security-boundary. Command substitution, indirection (`eval`, `xargs`,
# `$()`), interpreters (`python -c "open(...,'w')"`), and many tools not in
# the small write-command set below can still smuggle a write outside the
# root, because the hook neither executes nor fully parses the shell. Closing
# that would need a real shell interpreter, which is disproportionate here.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = allow, 2 = block. As with orchestrator-guard (issue #396)
# every block reason is written to stderr — the harness feeds stderr back to
# the model and ignores stdout on exit 2.
