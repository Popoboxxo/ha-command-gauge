# self-skip (disabled, or prerequisites missing). Exit non-zero = fail,

# dod.resolve_release_gates() (project.yaml `release-gates.docker-image-scan.enabled`
# > dod-preset default > this header's `enabled_by_default`). The `:=` form
# only assigns when the var is still unset, so an explicit
# `PRE_RELEASE_GATE_ENABLED=false bash release-gates/docker-image-scan.sh`
# always wins for a one-off, single-gate override. Shared skip/message logic
# lives in hook_gate_check_enabled() (lib/hook_common.sh).
