# description: Pre-release gate — blocks release if a generated artifact is older than the source it was built from (config: .meta-config/generated-artifacts.yaml; fallback when that file does not exist: generated-artifacts.yaml)
# enabled_by_default: false

# --- Gate contract (see docs/RELEASE_GATES.md) ---
# Run standalone (`bash release-gates/artifact-freshness.sh`) or via the
# release-gates/ dispatcher (pre-release-check.sh). Exit 0 = pass or
# self-skip (disabled, or prerequisites missing). Exit non-zero = fail,
# blocks the release.

# --- Enabled/disabled ---
# Baked at sync-time by scripts/lib/hooks.py::sync_release_gates() from
# dod.resolve_release_gates() (project.yaml `release-gates.artifact-freshness.enabled`
# > dod-preset default > this header's `enabled_by_default`). The `:=` form
# only assigns when the var is still unset, so an explicit
# `PRE_RELEASE_GATE_ENABLED=false bash release-gates/artifact-freshness.sh`
# always wins for a one-off, single-gate override. Shared skip/message logic
# lives in hook_gate_check_enabled() (lib/hook_common.sh).

# --- Config convention ---
# .meta-config/generated-artifacts.yaml at the consumer project root, falling
# back to generated-artifacts.yaml when that file does not exist (the fallback
# is chosen by file absence, not by the absence of the .meta-config/
# directory). The primary path wins when both exist.
# Supported subset (stdlib-only, NOT a full YAML parser):
#
#   artifacts:
#     - source: VERSION
#       generated: dist/manifest.json
#     - source: src/schema.py
#       generated: docs/api/schema.json
#
# One list under a single top-level `artifacts:` key; each entry is a
# `- source: <path-or-glob>` / `generated: <path-or-glob>` pair on two
# consecutive lines. No nesting, no anchors, no multi-line scalars.
