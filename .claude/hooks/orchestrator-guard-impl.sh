# Real orchestrator-guard logic. NOT a standalone hook — invoked by
# orchestrator-guard.sh (thin self-health wrapper, issue #630), which pipes
# the PreToolUse JSON payload to this script's stdin after syntax-checking
# it. Do not register this file directly in settings.json (it has no
# `# hook:`/`# event:` header on purpose, so scripts/lib/hooks.py never
# registers it as its own hook entry).
# The `# version:` line above IS still read by check_stale_deployed_hooks()
# (scripts/lib/consistency/hook_drift.py, issue #630) so a project that
# doesn't re-sync after this file changes gets a drift warning — bump it
# whenever this file's logic changes, independent of the wrapper's version.

set -uo pipefail

# It self-checks whether orchestrator.strict mode is enabled in project.yaml.
# If strict mode is off, the hook exits 0 immediately and imposes no overhead.
#
# Only mutating tools (Write, Edit, Bash) are intercepted.
# Research tools (read, glob, grep) are never blocked.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = allow, 2 = block.
#
# On exit 2 the harness feeds *stderr* back to the model as the block reason
# and ignores stdout. Writing the guard message to stdout (as versions <=2.1.0
# did) therefore surfaced a bare "hook error: No stderr output" instead of the
# explanation — the block worked, the reason was lost (issue #396). Every
# message emitted on a blocking path must go to stderr.
#
# Identity note (see agent-meta issues #390, #683): Claude Code's PreToolUse
# payload now carries an `agent_id` common input field, harness-set (not
# self-reported), "present only when the hook fires inside a subagent call"
# (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md) — this was NOT true when this
# hook was first written (issue #390), which is why the sentinel convention
# below exists at all. `agent_id` reliably distinguishes ANY dispatched
# subagent's tool call (Write/Edit/Bash alike) from a main-thread call,
# without needing a content-embedded marker — see AGENT_ID usage below and
# in the strict-mode block.
#
# The sentinel convention remains for a narrower purpose the harness field
# doesn't cover: identifying WHICH ROLE a Bash call belongs to (git vs.
# orchestrator vs. anything else), for the git-mutation/destructive gates
# below — `agent_id` says "this is some subagent", not "this is the git
# agent". Authorized delegates (git, orchestrator agent templates)
# self-declare by prefixing every Bash command with a sentinel comment
# line: `#agent-meta:agent=<name>`. This remains a soft, self-reported
# convention (matches the framework's existing A2A trust model, see
# .claude/rules/a2a-delegation-gates.md) — it is not a security boundary
# against a malicious agent, only a fix for the role-identification gap
# `agent_id` alone can't close.
#
# Hardening (issue #516): a real-world incident showed a non-git worker
# self-declaring as `git` via this sentinel to run destructive stash
# operations. Elevation is therefore capability-scoped and audited:
#   * `orchestrator` sentinel exempts ONLY from strict-mode main-chat
#     blocking (Bash) — it NEVER bypasses the git-mutation block.
#   * `git` sentinel exempts ONLY from the git-mutation block.
#   * Destructive operations (force push, reset --hard, clean -f, stash
#     drop/clear, filter-branch/filter-repo, working-tree wipe) are
#     blocked EVEN with a valid `git` sentinel and require the user to
#     approve/run them manually.
#   * Every elevation attempt is appended to .claude/hooks/.guard-audit.log
#     for post-hoc review.
# Identity itself remains unverifiable at hook level (provider payload has
# no agent field) — this is mitigation, not cryptographic trust; see
# .claude/rules/a2a-delegation-gates.md ("Bekannte Grenzen").
#
# Destructive-gate scope note (issues #542/#551/#590/#591/#602): the
# destructive gate now shares ONE tokenizer with the mutation gate (the
# `parse_git` / `is_destructive` / `is_mutation` functions in the Python
# heredoc below) instead of matching raw regexes against the whole command
# string. It only inspects tokens of
# real `git <subcommand>` invocations, which closes several prior gaps:
#   * #602: destructive keywords inside an unrelated command's quoted text
#     argument (e.g. `gh issue create --body "git push --force ..."`,
#     `echo "reset --hard"`) no longer match — they are not `git` tokens.
#   * #590: a leading `+` on a push refspec (`git push origin +main`) forces
#     a non-fast-forward push like --force and is now detected, while a plain
#     `HEAD:main` refspec (no `+`) is not treated as destructive.
#   * #591: global `-c key=val` / `--config key=val` options are consumed
#     together with their value token, so the real subcommand is still found
#     (previously `-c core.pager=x push` hid `push`); additionally
#     `core.pager` / `core.editor` config keys are flagged as inherently
#     destructive (arbitrary-command execution / RCE) regardless of the
#     subcommand.
# Known limitation (issue #592, deliberate — best-effort convention boundary,
# not a security boundary; see .claude/rules/branch-guard.md#guard-terminologie
# for the definition of both terms): command substitution and indirection
# such as `$(...)`, backticks, `xargs`, or `eval` can still smuggle a git
# mutation past the tokenizer, because the hook does not execute or fully
# parse the shell. Closing this would require a real shell interpreter, which
# is disproportionate for a convention tool; documented in
# .claude/rules/branch-guard.md ("Bekannte Grenzen").
