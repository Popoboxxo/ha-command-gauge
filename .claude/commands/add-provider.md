Add an AI provider to this project. $ARGUMENTS

**Step 1 — Discover available providers**

Read `.agent-meta/config/ai-providers.yaml` and extract all provider names listed under `providers:`.
Read `.meta-config/project.yaml` and extract the `ai-providers:` list (currently active providers).

Show the user:
- Already active providers (skip these)
- Available providers from the registry (can be added immediately)

**Step 2 — User decision**

If $ARGUMENTS names a known provider from the registry → proceed to Step 3.
If $ARGUMENTS names an unknown provider (not in registry) → proceed to Step 4.
If no $ARGUMENTS → ask the user which provider they want to add, showing the available list.

**Step 3 — Add known provider**

1. Add the provider name to `ai-providers:` in `.meta-config/project.yaml`
2. Run sync: `python .agent-meta/scripts/sync.py`
3. Check sync output for warnings
4. Report: which new files were generated (agents, rules, settings, isolation artifacts)
5. If the provider requires secrets (e.g. API keys): show the relevant gitignored local config file path and what needs to be filled in

**Step 4 — Request new provider via GitHub issue**

The requested provider is not yet in the agent-meta registry. Before filing the issue, do a brief pre-analysis:

- What is the provider's name and tool/CLI name?
- Does it have a known agents directory convention?
- Does it support rules/hooks/commands natively?
- Does it have a known permission/deny mechanism for file access?
- What model IDs does it use?

Then delegate to the `meta-feedback` agent with this task:

File a GitHub issue titled: "feat: add [ProviderName] as a supported AI provider"

Body should include:
- Provider name and CLI/tool name
- Pre-analysis findings from above
- Links to official docs if known
- Requested capabilities: agents_dir, context_file, has_rules, has_hooks, has_settings, model-tiers
- Label: "enhancement", "new-provider"

**Step 5 — Implement a genuinely new provider**

Steps 3/4 cover activating an already-registered provider or filing an issue for one that
isn't. This step is for actually implementing support for a new provider in the agent-meta
codebase itself. Assumption: a simple, file-based provider (Markdown agents, own context
file, no exotic settings format).

As of this Wave (post #627/#628/#629), most former Python touchpoints were eliminated —
provider differences now resolve through `config/ai-providers.yaml` and sister registries
instead of hardcoded Python maps/`elif` chains. Do NOT re-add a Python branch for something
already covered by YAML lookup (see `provider-agnostic` skill for the rule).

**Required YAML config (always):**
1. `config/ai-providers.yaml` — provider block (identity, paths, capabilities, model tiers,
   gitignore/isolation dirs, `agents_dir`, `bash_tool_name`, `context_file`)
2. `config/provider-capabilities.yaml` — orchestration-capability entry
3. `config/provider-bootstrap.yaml` — bootstrap entry (`mechanism: file-based, action: none`
   for a simple provider — routes through `BootstrapEngine`, no Python needed)
4. `config/provider-tools.yaml` — tool whitelist (+ `terminal_tool` entry if the CLI name
   differs from the provider name)
5. `templates/configs/<Provider>.project-template.md` (+ a settings-template if the
   provider needs a settings file)

**Remaining code touchpoints (only if the provider genuinely needs something no existing
config-key covers):**
6. `scripts/lib/commands.py` (~line 124) — the provider-to-commands-dir dispatch is still a
   4-way `if/elif` with `else: return` (silently no commands, no log line) — add a branch
   here only if the provider supports native slash-commands with a directory convention not
   yet expressible via a capability flag.
7. `scripts/lib/mcp_provider_config.py` (`_write_provider_config`, ~line 395) — only if the
   provider needs a genuinely new MCP settings file format (unknown format → warning + skip,
   not silent).
8. Hook adapter — only if `has_hooks: true` and the provider's hook event/payload model
   differs from Claude Code's `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` JSON-on-stdin contract. No adapter
   concept exists yet for this (tracked separately, see `hook_protocol` in
   `config/ai-providers.yaml`) — treat a hooks-capable new provider as its own follow-up,
   not a same-day addition.

**Already eliminated — do NOT add these as new touchpoints:** a per-provider `agents_dir`
map in `context.py`, a `pending_tasks` map in `lifecycle_check.py`, a bash-tool-name map in
`viz.py`, a hardcoded `valid_providers` list in `setup.py` (now derived from the YAML
registry keys), an isolation branch in `isolation.py`, the `provider_transform.py` `elif`
chain, and the Gemini-specific bootstrap bypass in `agent_sync.py` — all now resolve through
YAML config or `BootstrapEngine`. If you find yourself re-adding a `provider ==` Python
branch for something already covered by these, stop — extend the YAML config instead
(`provider_registry_completeness` lint rule + `provider-agnostic` skill are the guard-rail).
